		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<p>I’m a recent graduate from the University of Pittsburgh, and I've lived here for basically my whole life. Though I'd prefer to stay here because I'm familar with the area, I don't have any particular objections to moving away in the future. </p>
		<p>Coming out of high school, I was unsure of my career interests until I discovered a passion for programming in my first year of college. I applied myself heavily since then, both academically and while working part-time to fund my education.
			Thanks to a number of years working in retail, I've learned much about customer-relations and teamwork. Now that I'm working professionally as a developer, I can say that the experience was good for me.</p>
		<p>Currently I work as a Junior SQL Developer Consultant. I'd love to travel more someday, but for now I'm focused on working on my career.</p>
		<h1>Programming Interests</h1>
		<p>The majority of my professional experience right now is in databases and creating custom data-import programs. In my free time, I mostly work on little games and some personal-use CRUD apps (library managers, finance tracking, etc.).</p>
